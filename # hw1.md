## GitHub Repository URL
https://github.com/HadeemS/.dotfiles

## Summary
During this lab, I set up a personal repository for my dotfiles on GitHub. The process involved creating a hidden directory, initializing a Git repository, and configuring SSH access for secure connections. Initially, I faced challenges related to SSH key configuration and permissions, which I resolved by generating a new SSH key and adding it to my GitHub account.

While working through the lab instructions, I also encountered issues with merging local and remote changes. By following the guidance provided, I was able to pull the remote changes, resolve any conflicts, and push my local changes successfully. This experience enhanced my understanding of Git and GitHub, particularly in managing repositories and collaborating on projects.

Overall, this lab was a valuable learning experience, as it allowed me to practice essential version control skills and familiarize myself with command-line tools. I feel more confident in using Git for my future projects and collaborating with others.

## Commands Used
1. Create a hidden directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir .dotfiles
   nano 
   ls 
   ls ~a
   rm 
   cd 
   cd ..
